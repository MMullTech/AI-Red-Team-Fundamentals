# AI-Red-Team-Fundamentals
Repository for tracking and documenting foundational learning in Large Language Model (LLM) Prompt Injection and AI Safety principles.

### Education
* BA: Biology & Psychology (Double Major)

### Profile
**Specialist in High-Acuity Risk Assessment and System Failure Analysis.** Twenty-one years as a Paramedic, including **14 years in Critical Care** with **5 years of high-stress Flight Medicine**. This experience translates directly to Proactive Threat Modeling (Red Teaming), where success requires finding minute protocol deviations and anticipating catastrophic system failure under duress.

**Core Transferable Skills:**
* **Rapid Triage & Decision-Making:** Pattern recognition under extreme time constraints.
* **System Integrity & Protocol Adherence:** Meticulous documentation and adherence to life-critical protocols.
* **Adversarial Modeling:** Trained to anticipate every potential failure mode and catastrophic outcome (the "what if" scenarios).

### Current Focus
* LLM Fundamentals (Tokens, Context Windows)
* Prompt Injection and Jailbreaking Attack Vectors
* AI Policy and Alignment Failure
